### Personal Information

Name: Deon McGruddy

Student Number: s3858512

Email: s3858512@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Deon McGruddy and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I am 23 years old and I grew up in rural Victoria in a place called Wodonga.

My grandparents were Irish and Scottish.

I can speak English, novice Japanese and novice Hindi.  

My favourite things to do are reading and playing video games in my spare time.  

### Interest in IT

IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing togther my own at 16.

I chose to study at RMIT online in order to delve deeper into the world of information technolgy that surrounds every step of my life. I work most days each week so my time to travel to a physical campus is limited. 

During my studies I want to learn how to create programs with my own two hands. I wish to create a base to not only find employment in the industry but explore potential careers and learning in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality. 

### Ideal Job

My Ideal job is to be researching and implementing for a company such as Valve Software.

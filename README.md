### Personal Information

Name: Deon McGruddy

Student Number: s3858512

Email: s3858512@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Deon McGruddy and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I am 23 years old and I grew up in rural Victoria in a place called Wodonga.

My grandparents were Irish and Scottish.

I can speak English, novice Japanese and novice Hindi.  

My favourite things to do are reading and playing video games in my spare time.  

### Interest in IT

IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing togther my own at 16.

I chose to study at RMIT online in order to delve deeper into the world of information technolgy that surrounds every step of my life. I work most days each week so my time to travel to a physical campus is limited. 

During my studies I want to learn how to create programs with my own two hands. I wish to create a base to not only find employment in the industry but explore potential careers and learning in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality. 

### Ideal Job

My Ideal job is to be researching and implementing for a company such as Valve Software.

Here is a link to a job posting Valve has put up for an [Software Engineer for VR & Hardware](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=41)
Here is a snapshot incase the link goes down.

The job involves exploring, advancing and implementing VR technology. Working with a team with a wide array of skills to improve and advance the rapidly developing VR landscape. 

A job like this sparks my passion for both working as a team and for pursuing new technologies. 

In order to pursue such a job not only will I need experience in low level languages such as C++ but also in depth experience with hardware design, 3d rendering and many other skills.

I currently have completed classes in C++ prior to RMIT and have limited hardware coding with arduino controllers.

I will need to build and extensive portfolio in programming for low level languages. As well as experience in game design and experience with coding for VR technologies. RMIT offers courses in these subjects and studying them during my time here would be a great step forward.

The website I used was [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) and you can find the full results of my test [here](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/957f368a66407).

The results of this test show that I am best suited as a diplomat. There to lubricate the gears for a team so that everything runds smoothly. However I should take care to put effort into the work I do not just helping others.

#### Learning Style
Here is how i best learn:

The website I used was [Education Planner](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml).

This indicates that I learn best with visual input. When understanding topics or presenting them using diagrams and images is key. Keeping a log or spreadsheet of tasks to be completed, who needs to complete it and when would do any group with myself in it wonders.

#### Big Five Personality Test

This is the result of my Big Five Test:

The website I used was [Truity.com](https://www.truity.com)

This would indicate that I am high in agreeableness and openness. Interacting with people I am likely to be swayed by new ideas or opinions. When working on a project I should make sure to stick with whats feasible and stick within constraints.

### Personal Information

Name: Deon McGruddy

Student Number: s3858512

Email: s3858512@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Deon McGruddy and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I am 23 years old and I grew up in rural Victoria in a place called Wodonga.

My grandparents were Irish and Scottish.

I can speak English, novice Japanese and novice Hindi.  

My favourite things to do are reading and playing video games in my spare time.  

### Interest in IT

IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing togther my own at 16.

I chose to study at RMIT online in order to delve deeper into the world of information technolgy that surrounds every step of my life. I work most days each week so my time to travel to a physical campus is limited. 

During my studies I want to learn how to create programs with my own two hands. I wish to create a base to not only find employment in the industry but explore potential careers and learning in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality. 

### Ideal Job

My Ideal job is to be researching and implementing for a company such as Valve Software.

Here is a link to a job posting Valve has put up for an [Software Engineer for VR & Hardware](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=41)
Here is a snapshot incase the link goes down.

The job involves exploring, advancing and implementing VR technology. Working with a team with a wide array of skills to improve and advance the rapidly developing VR landscape. 

A job like this sparks my passion for both working as a team and for pursuing new technologies. 

In order to pursue such a job not only will I need experience in low level languages such as C++ but also in depth experience with hardware design, 3d rendering and many other skills.

I currently have completed classes in C++ prior to RMIT and have limited hardware coding with arduino controllers.

I will need to build and extensive portfolio in programming for low level languages. As well as experience in game design and experience with coding for VR technologies. RMIT offers courses in these subjects and studying them during my time here would be a great step forward.
